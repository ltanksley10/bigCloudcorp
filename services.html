	    		<p class="content">High-availability? Fault-tolerant? RPO or RTO? More buzzwords and acronyms, but they also have very important meanings. 
	    		Obviously, you want your datasets and workloads secured from loss or corruption, but how to do it? Backups? Well, what kind of backups? 
	    		Cloud-native Disaster Recovery (DR) plans keep your vital systems going no matter what. Fault-Tolerant means your application or website is 
	    		built to stay online in the event of a disaster, such as infrastructure failure at physical data centers. High-Availability means your 
	    		application is built to scale to the fluctuating trends that makes the world turn. In DR there is a timeline. In the middle of that timeline 
	    		there is the “crash” or system failure. On either side there is RPO and RTO and “back online” at the end of said timeline. Recovery Point 
	    		Objective (RPO) is the time you took your latest backup. It’s the point in that your business will recover to after the failure. Recovery Time
	    		Objective is the time it will take to recover from system failure and resume business as normal. Your product being online is important, so 
	    		understanding Availability and Recovery are paramount.</p>

	    		<h2 class="services">Architecture:</h2>
	    		<p class="content">Serverless should be the initial approach to any architecture at this point. Think about reverse-engineering monolithic 
	    		designs to achieve process optimization giving better insight to existing and additional workflows. Microservices connect each feature or 
	    		task within your application enabling the solution to be loosely coupled i.e. Well-Architected Framework (AWS). Every process that occurs 
	    		inside your application or website can be implemented individually freeing up IT budget resources for additional functionality. Modernizing 
	    		your product pipeline by modernizing your development pipeline. Obtain the Continuous Implementation/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) that sets 
	    		DevOp teams apart from others. Distributed technologies (cloud) can even give one the ability to design traditional web server and database 
	    		architectures and still realize cost optimization. </p>

	    		<h3 class="services">Migration:</h3>
	    		<p class="content">You may have read this on our site in other places: we learned the cloud, we didn’t just start there. We know how things 
	    		are supposed to work on-premise. Migration is the perfect time to ask why something was done a particular way previously. Migrating to the cloud 
	    		can become a fact-finding mission, and those facts lead to all new architectures you might not think are possible. Your digital pilgrimage can 
	    		be beneficial in opening additional revenue streams utilizing data with powerful and rapidly-scaling analysis tools that can only be found in 
	    		the cloud. Product innovation starts with creating new functionality by exposing your team to agile sets of tools, all while reducing your total 
	    		cost of ownership.</p>
